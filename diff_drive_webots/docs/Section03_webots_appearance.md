In this section of the documentation we shall see how to adjust the appearance functionalities of the Webots Interface.This is going to be a pretty short section and there is not much to discuss here.

    In order to rotate the camera around the x and y axis you can use your left mouse button  and drag along the screen.Now depending on if an object is clicked or not the rotation will be centred around either the object or the current position of the camera

# Rendering

You can enable plane rendering using the view menu  and this will render the scene as it normally should. You can also enable  wireframe rendering and this will render only the the Skeleton of the entire scene just  if you just want to visualise that and it will also help to reduce the computational expenses of the environment. 


## Optional Rendering

Using the optional rendering submenu you can show various options including co-ordinate systems, all bonding objects, contact points,video connector Axes, range finder frustums, Lidar Ray path ,lidar point clouds, camera frustums, distance sensor rays, light sensor rays,light positions, pen painting rays, skin skeleton, radar  frustum, centre of mass, centre of buoyancy and support polygon
